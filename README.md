# lab1_a: Combinational Exercises and Debugging Sequential Machines

In the second week of class, we'll be releasing the main component of the lab (`lab1_b`). This pre-lab is meant to warm you up and give you some practice with Bluespec and reasoning about hardware. It is also meant to give you a chance to see points of confusion that we can clarify in office hours or recitation.

This pre-lab has two parts: combinational exercises, and a sequential debugging exercise. They each have their own handout. Please track how much time you spend on each part.

- In the first part, we ask you to implement several combinational circuits.
- In the second part, we provide you with a buggy module that implements a [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) between two vectors. We have declared the state elements at the top of the module for you, but there are some bugs in the rules and methods. We ask you to identify and fix them.


`make submit` in the main directory will locally run the tests and submit the log for simple autograding
